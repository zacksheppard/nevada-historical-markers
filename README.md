## Nevada State Historical Maker map

This app is a listing and map of the Historical Markers in the State of Nevada. In addition to the markers themselves, information is used from the [State Historic Preservation Office](http://shpo.nv.gov/home/historical-markers) and [this wonderful page of markers](http://www.oiccam.com/reno/historical_markers/nvmarkers/number.htm) compiled by [Jim Alexander](http://www.oiccam.com/reno/historical_markers/nvmarkers/).

Data in the markers is still a little rough as there wasn't a way to seperate the descriptions so that is still a work in progress.

### Configuration:
* Ruby 2.1.2, Rails 4.1.4
* For the map I'm first using CartoDB because I'd like to try it out. After that is done I'll also create a map myself using JavaScript and Google Maps.
* Because it is more useful on mobile I'll optimize for both desktop and mobile views and add location awareness.

### Why?
When you travel around the state of Nevada you see many historical markers like [this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/quikbeam/192446147). I've heard many Nevadans say they'd love to know more about these, where they are, what they mean and how many are really around. They are always fun to stumble upon especially when you are out in what seems to be the middle of nowhere in Nevada. They very often are a marker of history that left no other traces behind. 

I've heard many Nevadans say that they wish they knew more about them or knew where more of them are and that is what this project is about.
